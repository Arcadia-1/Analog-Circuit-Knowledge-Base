# Analog Circuit Knowledge Base

A knowledge repository for analog circuit design fundamentals, focusing on amplifier theory, calculations, and analysis.

## Contents

### `5T-Differential-Amplifier-Analysis.md`
Complete mathematical analysis of 5-transistor differential amplifiers including differential/common-mode gains, CMRR, PSRR, noise analysis (thermal and flicker), and frequency response (poles, zeros, transfer function).

### `Amplifier-Bandwidth-Calculations.md`
Comprehensive guide to amplifier bandwidth theory including gain-bandwidth product (GBW) fundamentals, closed-loop bandwidth calculations, gain-bandwidth tradeoffs, and multi-stage bandwidth analysis with visual comparisons.

### `Phase-Noise-Calculations.md`
Bidirectional conversion formulas between phase noise and amplitude noise, including definitions, step-by-step derivations, direct formulas, and worked examples for high-speed applications.

## Directories

### `code/`
Python scripts for generating figures and visualizations.

### `figures/`
Generated plots and images referenced in the documentation.

### `reference/`
Local reference materials including LaTeX source documents and papers.

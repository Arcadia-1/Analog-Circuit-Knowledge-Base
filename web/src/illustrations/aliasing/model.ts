/**
 * Aliasing and the Nyquist zones: whatever frequency goes into a sampler, it comes out somewhere in 0 … fs/2, and so do
 * its harmonics. Keeping only every N-th sample does the same again at fs/N.
 * Ported from ADCToolbox 0.9.1 (github.com/Arcadia-1/ADCToolbox):
 *   fundamentals/frequency  fold_frequency_to_nyquist, find_coherent_frequency, through src/lib/frequency.ts
 *   siggen/nonidealities    apply_static_nonlinearity_hd, apply_thermal_noise, apply_quantization_noise
 *   spectrum/               analyze_spectrum, through src/lib/spectrum.ts
 * following its examples exp_c01 (six Nyquist zones) and exp_d00 (every N-th sample, no anti-alias filter).
 * python/adc_aliasing.py calls ADCToolbox on the same samples; tests/aliasing-model.test.ts compares the two.
 *
 * Frequencies are in hertz; the record is in codes of a 12-bit converter on a 0 … 1 V range, as exp_d00 has it.

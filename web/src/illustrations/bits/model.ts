/**
 * Reading the bits: what a SAR converter's raw output says before anything is reconstructed. How often each bit is 1,
 * where the part of the code from each bit down sits between its limits, the weights a sine fit finds and the ratios
 * between them, and how many effective bits each bit adds.
 * Ported from ADCToolbox 0.9.1 (github.com/Arcadia-1/ADCToolbox):
 *   dout/          analyze_bit_activity, analyze_overflow, analyze_weight_radix, analyze_enob_sweep
 *   calibration/   calibrate_weight_sine at a known frequency, through src/lib/calibration.ts
 *   spectrum/      analyze_spectrum with a Hamming window and automatic side bins, through src/lib/spectrum.ts
 * following its examples exp_d11, exp_d12, exp_d13 and exp_d14, whose SAR loop this repeats.
 * python/adc_reading_the_bits.py calls ADCToolbox on the same bits; tests/bits-model.test.ts compares the two.
 *
 * The converter's range is ±1, as in those examples: the input is 2·amplitude·sin + offset.
